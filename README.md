# Some Sass issue template

Feel free to use this template repository (hit the green Use this template button) if you are filing a bug report to [Some Sass](https://wkillerud.github.io/some-sass/contributing/reporting-bugs.html).

Add whatever Sass code you need to demonstrate the issue in the `src/` folder.

If you use non-default settings you can change them in `.vscode/settings.json`.
